- 1.1.0: 29 Jan 2013: By default, "element"s now ignore non-visible
  elements on the page; use { :invisible => true } to get the old
  behaviour.
- 1.2.0: 10 Jun 2013: Changes by bairyn.  Added caching, finding
based on parent element, and block validators.
- 1.3.0: 8 Aug 2013: Detect and work around errors caused by incorrect caching,
and add support for element arguments, evaluating elements under new parents,
finding based on children, and the :unique option to ensure only one element
matches a specification.
